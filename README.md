# PLN inflation
[![pln-inflation](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/pln-inflation/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/pln-inflation)

Convert prices in Polish złoty (ISO 4217 code 'PLN') from one year to another.


## Usage

```js
import inflation from 'pln-inflation';

const current = inflation({ year: 1995, amount: 10 });
console.log(`10 zł in 1995 was worth ${current} zł in 2021`);
```

## Documentation

There is a single function exported by the library that has one required and one optional argument. It returns the converted price.

### `inflation(from, [to])`

The required `from` argument and the optional `to` argument are similar objects.

#### `from`

- `amount` is the nominal price
- `year` is a year between 1995 and 2021

#### `to` (optional)

- `year` is a year between 1995 and 2021 and is 2021 (the last full year of data) by default

## Data source

All data comes from the [Statistics Poland (Polish: Główny Urząd Statystyczny)](https://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/ceny-handel/wskazniki-cen/wskazniki-cen-towarow-i-uslug-konsumpcyjnych-pot-inflacja-/roczne-wskazniki-cen-towarow-i-uslug-konsumpcyjnych/) and is therefore limited to years between 1950 and 2021. However due to redenomination of Polish złoty in 1995 this package is currently limited to years between 1995 and 2021.

## Prior art and motivation

- I came across ['us-inflation' package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/us-inflation).
- I was inspired by the president of the National Bank of Poland and his statement that ["inflation does not affect the wealth of Polish citizens"](https://youtu.be/njqEBOntE9I) (I rephrased it a bit for the sake of clarity).
